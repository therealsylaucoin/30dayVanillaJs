    <h1>Have a look at the Console</h1>

    <script>
        // start with numbers
        let age = 100;
        let age2 = age;
        console.log(age, age2); //return 100 100, simple enough

        age = 200;
        console.log(age, age2);//returns 200, 100 - because the value of 100 is stored in age2 at the moment, on line 16

        //same thing happens with strings
        let name = 'Syl';
        let name2 = name;
        console.log(name, name2);

        name = 'socoin';
        console.log(name, name2);

        //same thing with booleans
        let isCool = true;
        let isFresh = isCool;
        console.log(isCool, isFresh);

        isCool = false;
        console.log(isCool, isFresh);

        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;
        console.log(players, team);

        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux';

        // however what happens when we update that array?
        console.log(players, team); //In this case BOTH arrays are modified!

        // now here is the problem!
        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // one way
        const team2 = players.slice();
        team2[3] = 'Poppy';
        console.log(players, team, team2);

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);
        team3[3] = 'Jack';
        console.log(players, team, team2, team3);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];
        team4[3] = 'Timy';
        console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Syl Aucoin',
            age: 35
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const syl = person;
        console.log(person, syl);

        person.age = 36;
        console.log(person, syl);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        const syl2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 35 });
        const syl3 = Object.assign({}, person, { name: 'socoin', hobby: 'pottery' });
        console.log(person, syl, syl2, syl3);

        // ...spread
        const syl4 = { ...person }
        syl4.age = 32;
        console.log(person, syl, syl2, syl3, syl4);

        //this also works but is not recommended 
        //takes the object, turns it into a string, then back into an object
        const syl5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
